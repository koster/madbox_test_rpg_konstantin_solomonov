# The time it took you to perform the exercise
~15 hours

# The parts that were difficult for you and why
It's difficult to split enemy/player/unit code in a beneficial to a development time kind of way.

# The parts you think you could do better and how
Having more data orientied approach for configuration, storing all configuration seperately from prefabs and scenes, but it's hard to see much benifit from this at this project scale so I left it out.

# What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
I would add collisions, some static obstacles and ranged enemies.
